# Dataverse Exporters
A collection of community-developed metadata exporters that conform to the [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org) exporter service provider interface (SPI) 1.0.0 first released in Dataverse v5.14.

Documentation of the Exporter SPI will be available in the [Dataverse Guides](https://guides.dataverse.org) in the Advanced Installation and Developers Guides.

The example [MyJSON exporter jar](https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-exporters/raw/main/prebuilt-examples/dataverse-spi-export-examples-1.0.0.jar) discussed in the guides can be downloaded by clicking the link in this sentence.

Community Members are encouraged to contribute to the documentation there and here, to add crosslinks, and to create additional Exporters beyond the single simple example provided today.
